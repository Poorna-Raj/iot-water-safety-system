Lakes and reservoirs are more popular spots for recreational activities than a pool such as swimming, diving and sunbathing. but many people engage with these activities without checking the safety of the water they are entering. example, such as a child want to take a swim but that day temperature was very high or some imbalance pH range, he might get a very serious injury and the traditional methods like sample checking are time consuming and ineffcient for immediate decision making.

with the evolution of the Internet of Things technologies it is now possible to monitor water safety in real time using sensors that not expensive and clould based technology. In this project aims to develop an IoT based lake water quality and safety system, which will send data to a heat map in real time by continuously checking the water quality snf the safety, by this can provide both public and relevant authorities with immediate access to critical water safety information and helping to redues risks associated with unsafe water conditions.

by integrating IoT sensors with cloud technology, and the system user friendly visual interfaces , real time monitoring will improving public awareness and decision making and will address gaps in water safety assessment particularly for popular lakes and recreational areas.
